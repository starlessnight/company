		<span class="c0">Please read these terms and conditions of use
			(&quot;Terms of Use&quot;) carefully before you download or launch

		<span class="c0 c2">INTRODUCTION</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c1">
		<span class="c0">These Terms of Use represent the agreement
			(&quot;Agreement&quot;) between you and Metropia, Inc.
			(&quot;Metropia&quot;) with respect to Smartrek. All references
			herein to &quot;you&quot; and &quot;your&quot; means you, your
			employees, agents, and contractors, and any other entity on whose
			behalf you accept these terms and conditions, all of whom shall also
			be bound by this Agreement.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c1">
		<span class="c0">Metropia may revise these terms and conditions
			at any time, with or without notice to you. You should visit </span><span
			class="c0 c9"><a class="c6"
			href="http://www.smartrekmobile.com">www.smartrekmobile.com</a></span><span
			class="c0">&nbsp;from time to time to review the then current

	</p>
	<p class="c1">
		<span class="c0 c2">SMARTREK</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c1">
		<span class="c0">Smartrek allows you to obtain via your
			wireless device GPS-assisted navigation instructions to destinations
			throughout the available markets as specified in </span><span class="c3 c0"><a
			class="c6" href="http://www.smartrekmobile.com">www.smartrekmobile.com</a></span><span
			class="c0">, depending on your cellular carrier. Smartrek
			considers time of day, traffic, time of departure, route selection
			and other factors to provide various departure and route options for
			your trip. &nbsp;These departure time and route options may not be
			the departure times and route you often use. &nbsp;Smartrek awards
			points (&ldquo;Trek Points&rdquo;) to you if you (i) comply with the
			route provided, and (ii) depart at your reserved time. &nbsp;Trek
			Points have no monetary value, and can be redeemed only for prizes
			and awards offered by Metropia, as identified on its website.
			&nbsp;Metropia reserves the right to alter how Trek Points are
			calculated and awarded or to cease offering Trek Points altogether.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c1">
		<span class="c0">Smartrek is for your internal business and
			personal use and is not for resale or other transfer or disposition
			to any other person or entity.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c1">
		<span class="c0">Smartrek utilizes map and other data licensed
			to Metropia by third parties for the benefit of you and other end
			users. This Agreement includes end-user terms required by these
			companies (set forth at the end of this Agreement), and thus your use
			of Smartrek is limited by and subject to such terms.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c1">
		<span class="c0 c2">YOUR LOCATION AND ROUTE INFORMATION</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c1">
		<span class="c0">For Metropia to provide Smartrek and Trek
			Points, Metropia must record your route information, including your
			point of origin, the address of your destination, the starting time
			of your trip, and the route you are instructed to follow, and must
			periodically receive your GPS location.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c1">
		<span class="c0">In using Smartrek, you allow Metropia to
			access your GPS hardware and otherwise obtain this location and route
			information, and to record, compile and display such information.
			Such information is subject to Metropia&#39;s privacy policy located
			at </span><span class="c0 c9"><a class="c6"

	</p>
	<p class="c1">
		<span class="c0 c2">SAFE AND LAWFUL USE OF SMARTREK</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c1">
		<span class="c0">You agree to comply with the following when
			using Smartrek:</span>
	</p>
	<ol class="c8" start="1">
		<li class="c1 c7"><span class="c0">Observe all traffic
				laws and otherwise drive safely.</span></li>
		<li class="c1 c7"><span class="c0">Use your own personal
				judgment while driving. If you feel that a route suggested by
				Smartrek instructs you to perform an unsafe or illegal maneuver,
				places you in an unsafe situation, or directs you into an area that
				you consider to be unsafe, do not follow such instructions.</span></li>
		<li class="c1 c7"><span class="c0">Do not input
				destinations, or otherwise interact with Smartrek, unless your
				vehicle is stationary and parked.</span></li>
		<li class="c1 c7"><span class="c0">Do not use Smartrek for
				any illegal, unauthorized, unintended, unsafe, hazardous, or
				unlawful purposes, or in any manner inconsistent with this
				Agreement.</span></li>
		<li class="c1 c7"><span class="c0">Arrange all GPS and
				wireless devices and cables necessary for use of Smartrek in a
				secure manner in your vehicle so that they will not interfere with
				your driving and will not prevent the operation of any safety device
				(such as an airbag).</span></li>
	</ol>
	<p class="c1">
		<span class="c0 c2">USE OF SMARTREK</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c1">
		<span class="c0">Metropia does not guarantee that the route
			produced by Smartrek is always a physically or logically feasible
			route. In the event Smartrek suggests a route or turn that is either
			physically impossible or may violate traffic laws or convention, you
			should exercise good judgment and ignore such suggested route or
			turn. &nbsp;Metropia is not responsible for any damage, injury or
			fatality caused by following Smartrek recommended routes. </span>
	</p>
	<p class="c1">
		<span class="c0">While you may exercise discretion to choose or
			not choose the reserved departure time and route, Trek Points
			associated with each reserved departure time and route will be
			awarded to you only if you successfully complete the reserved route
			within the planned departure time. In the event of an event beyond
			your or Metropia&rsquo;s control that causes you to be unable to
			start and/or finish the planned trip at the reserved time, Metropia
			is not responsible for awarding you the reserved Trek Point
			associated with the route. </span>
	</p>
	<p class="c1">
		<span class="c0">The method of how Trek Points are calculated
			is dynamic and may be updated or changed by Smartrek&rsquo;s internal
			rules and algorithms and/or at Metropia&rsquo;s discretion.
			&nbsp;Metropia does not release its internal calculation rules to any
			user. </span>
	</p>
	<p class="c1">
		<span class="c0">You can redeem Trek Points only in accordance
			with the Smartrek guidelines set forth on the Smartrek website.
			Availability of prizes, and the type, quality, quantity and type of
			prize available, is subject to change and availability. Metropia has
			the right to change or modify the Trek Point redemption rules and
			policies at any time without giving prior notice to you. </span>
	</p>
	<p class="c1">
		<span class="c0 c2">TELEPHONE/DATA CHARGES</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c1">
		<span class="c0">You are responsible for any fees assessed by
			your wireless telephone carrier to access Smartrek, including any
			data plan charges, toll, out-of-area, roaming, or other telephone
			connection charges. Standard messaging rates and other charges may
			apply when using certain features in Smartrek.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c1">
		<span class="c0 c2">TERMINATION</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c1">
		<span class="c0">Metropia reserves the right to terminate your
			access to Smartrek at any time for any or no reason and without
			notice to you.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c1">
		<span class="c0">You may terminate Smartrek at any time by
			notifying Metropia via: (i) an email addressed to&nbsp;</span><span

			href="mailto:webmaster@smartrekmobile.com">webmaster@smartrekmobile.com</a></span><span

			notice.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c1">
		<a name="h.30j0zll"></a><span class="c0">In the event of any
			such termination, you must:</span>

	<ol class="c8" start="1">
		<li class="c4 c14"><a name="h.1fob9te"></a><span class="c0">Cease

				the Software from all computers and wireless devices on which it was
				resident.</span></li>

		<span class="c0">All terms and conditions which by their nature
			or their terms should survive termination or expiration of this
			Agreement, including without limitation all statements of ownership,

			so survive.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c1">
		<span class="c0 c2">ACCOUNT INFORMATION</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c1">
		<span class="c0">You agree: (a) when signing up for Smartrek,
			to provide Metropia with true, accurate, current, and complete
			information about yourself, and (b) to inform Metropia promptly of
			any changes to such information to keep it true, accurate, current
			and complete.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c1">
		<span class="c0">If you provide Metropia with any information
			that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or Metropia
			has reasonable grounds to suspect so, Metropia has the right to
			suspend or terminate your access to Smartrek.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c1">
		<span class="c0">All of your account information, as well as

	<p class="c1">
		<span class="c0">Metropia also does not warrant that your use

	<p class="c1">
		<span class="c0">Metropia also does not warrant the accuracy of

	</p>
	<p class="c1">
		<span class="c0">Metropia has technological and operational

	<p class="c1">
		<span class="c0">You may not resell, assign, or transfer any of

	<p class="c1">
		<span class="c0">If you are an agency, department, or other
